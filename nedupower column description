This file represents the column description of the file_path_timeseries = r"C:/Users/cusa/Downloads/nedupower.csv" used in the simulation and csv attached as nedupower
nedupower represents the yearly hourly energy flow simulation results from SAM and the energy flow model methodology descriped in the methodology.
It describes all csv files with similar headings for the summer and wwinter analysis
time_step: hourly time step;	SI: ScenarioI energy flow results in kW;	S2:ScenarioII energy flow results in kW;	S3:ScenarioIII energy flow results in kW;	
SY1_G: ScenarioI energy flow results in MW representing only net generation (negative values of SI/1000 in MW;	
SY1_L:ScenarioI energy flow results in MW representing only net load (positve values of SI/1000 in MW);		
SY2_G:ScenarioII energy flow results in MW representing only net generation (negative values of SI/1000 in MW);
SY2_L:ScenarioII energy flow results in MW representing only net load (positve values of SI/1000 in MW);	
SY3_G:ScenarioIII energy flow results in MW representing only net generation (negative values of SI/1000 in MW);
SY3L:ScenarioIII energy flow results in MW representing only net load (positve values of SI/1000 in MW);		
BawY:	ScenarioI energy flow results in kW of the baseline descriped below;
BY_G: Baseline energy flow results in kW representing only net generation (negative values of BawY/1000 in MW);	This baseline is a system with PV and no batteries. However, there is a direct consumption by the PV by load.
This idea was used to reduce simulation time, power flow from not converging and to focus on the effect of the PV surplus(net generation) on the grid.
